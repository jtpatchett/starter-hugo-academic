Hi, I'm Joseph Patchett and I am a consultant at Infosys Limited and a graduate student at NJIT. My research interests include graph theory, machine learning, and high performance computing. Most of my current research involves Arkouda which is an open source framework for high performance computing. In my full time job I am a certified SuccessFactors consultant with experience in EC, RCM, LMS, and CPI. I have worked with companies of all different sizes and consulted on various HR digital transformation projects. On the rare occasions when I am not researching or working full time I enjoy hiking, cooking, and playing board games with friends.
